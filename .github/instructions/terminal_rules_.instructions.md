# Terminal Commands Execution Rules ## CRITICAL: Hebrew Character Issue Workaround ### Problem Description The VS Code PowerShell terminal sometimes prepends a Hebrew character `ב` before commands, causing them to fail with "command not recognized" errors. ### MANDATORY SOLUTION **When encountering the Hebrew character `ב` error:** 1. **ALWAYS retry the same command immediately** 2. **Retry up to 5 times if needed** 3. **Use `cmd /c` wrapper as alternative:** - Instead of: `git status` - Use: `cmd /c "git status"` 4. **Never give up on first failure** - the issue is intermittent ### Examples of Errors to Retry ``` בgit : The term 'בgit' is not recognized... בnpm : The term 'בnpm' is not recognized...  בcd : The term 'בcd' is not recognized... ``` ### Automatic Retry Strategy When you see these errors: 1. ✅ Try command again (attempt 2) 2. ✅ Try command again (attempt 3)  3. ✅ Try with `cmd /c "command"` wrapper 4. ✅ Try again with wrapper (attempt 2) 5. ✅ Only then report issue to user ### Best Practice Commands **For Git operations, ALWAYS use:** ```bash cmd /c "cd C:\TikTax && git <command>" ``` **For npm operations:** ```bash cmd /c "cd C:\TikTax\frontend && npm <command>" ``` **For file operations:** ```bash cmd /c "cd C:\TikTax && <command>" ``` ## NEVER STOP AT FIRST FAILURE - ALWAYS RETRY! --- **This is a known VS Code terminal issue and NOT a project problem.** **Persistence in retrying WILL resolve it.**
